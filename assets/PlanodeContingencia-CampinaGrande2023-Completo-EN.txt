Summary of the Campina Grande Contingency Plan
The municipality of Campina Grande, located in the Brazilian semi-arid region, has 23 mapped risk areas vulnerable to floods, inundations, and landslides, especially during extreme weather events. The city's topography, with its steep slopes, and the presence of intermittent streams (Bodocongó and Piabas) contribute to the formation of these risk scenarios.

Risk Area Diagnosis

The main threats are concentrated in communities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Recurring problems include:

Irregular Occupation: Construction in unsuitable areas, such as riverbanks, steep hillsides, and floodplains. Critical examples include the "Invasão do Distrito dos Mecânicos," "Grotão (Itararé)," "Comunidade Rosa Mística," "Vila dos Teimosos," and "Novo Horizonte."

Precarious Infrastructure: Lack of basic sanitation, deficient or non-existent drainage systems, and substandard housing built with improvised materials, increasing health risks (like leptospirosis) and safety hazards.

Social Vulnerability: The populations in these areas are generally low-income and have little awareness of environmental risks, which complicates the preventive and response actions of the Civil Defense.

Action Strategies

The plan is structured into three main phases of action, following the protocols of the National Civil Protection and Defense System:

Preventive Actions: Focused on preventing the occurrence of disasters or minimizing their impact. These include continuous meteorological monitoring (24/7 hotlines 199 and 193), building inspections, public awareness campaigns, cleaning and clearing of channels and drainage systems, and maintaining human and material resources for immediate deployment.

Preparedness Actions: Activated upon alerts of intense rainfall. This involves on-site monitoring of critical areas, checking stock of humanitarian aid (food baskets, mattresses), and issuing alerts to communities at risk.

Response Actions: Executed during and after a disaster. The order of priority is:

Aid and rescue of victims.

Sheltering displaced people in safe locations and providing material assistance.

Inspecting properties for condemnation (partial or total).

Isolating and signaling dangerous areas.

Carrying out emergency repairs and restoring essential services.

Agency Responsibilities

The plan details the responsibilities of each municipal system agency to ensure a coordinated response:

Civil Defense (Defesa Civil): Coordinates all phases of the plan, manages information, conducts inspections, activates other secretariats, and liaises with state and federal entities.

Secretariat of Public Works (SECOB): Conducts technical inspections, carries out emergency and definitive construction work, and condemns buildings.

Urban Services (SESUMA): Ensures the cleaning and clearing of the drainage system and the removal of post-disaster debris.

Social Assistance (SEMAS): Manages shelters, registers affected families, distributes humanitarian aid, and administers the Social Rent program.

Health (SMS): Provides emergency care (SAMU, UPAs), carries out sanitary and epidemiological surveillance, and offers psychosocial support.

Fire Department (CBM): Acts directly in aid, search, and rescue operations.

Other Agencies: The Military Police, AESA (state water agency), CAGEPA (water utility), Energisa (power utility), and others provide support in security, water monitoring, and the restoration of services.
