# PluvIA

> PluvIA is a fully offline-capable Flutter mobile app that brings advanced AI-driven chat, weather forecasting, contact management, flood-risk assessment, and custom notifications right to your pocket.

> Powered by a locally-run Gemma3Nano model, PluvIA requires no constant internet connection—only periodic syncs for raw precipitation data.

## 🚀 Features

- **On-Device AI Chat**  
  Engage in natural-language conversations with Gemma3Nano, running entirely on your device.

- **Weather Forecasts**  
  View local temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more—computed offline from the last synced data.

- **Contacts CRUD**  
  Create, Read, Update, and Delete your contacts, all stored locally in secure storage.

- **Flood-Risk Analysis**  
  Ask PluvIA if any contact is in a high-risk flood zone. The model correlates contact locations and recent rainfall.

- **Flood Prediction**  
  Detect upcoming flood events based on offline analytics of recent rainfall trends.

- **Custom Notifications**  
  Schedule and receive personalized alerts—e.g., “Notify me if contact Alice is at risk” or “Warn me 1 hour before expected heavy rain.”

- **Periodic Data Sync**  
  Only needs internet when “Sync Rain Data” (e.g., once or twice a day). All heavy computation happens offline.
